### Two Basic Operators \<- and :

1.  \<- is called the "assignment operator", which assigns a value to a symbol

-   **example**:

```{r}
x<-1
x
```

The created symbol is called x, and the assigned value is 1. "x is 1" is a R expression.

At the same time, x is a numeric object with 1 element.

-   **another example**:

```{r}
msg <- "hello"
msg
```

msg is also a symbol assigned to the string *hello*, making msg a character vector.

-   **special case with \##**

![](images/Screenshot%202022-03-27%20at%2023.40.36.png)

Everything on the right side of double hash is comments. In the above expression, no value has been assigned to the symbol *hello*. Therefore, there is no print-out result.

2.  : is the operator for integer sequences creation.

```{r}
x <- 1:20
x
```

### Data Types in R

#### Atomic classes

R has 5 basic "atomic" classes of objects:\
1. character\
2. numeric (real numbers)\
3. integer\
4. complex\
5. logical (TRUE/FALSE)

#### Data Type: Vectors

The most basic factor in R is a vector that **only** contains **objects of the same class**

Vectors can be created using vector() function. E.g. An numeric vector with length = 10 by default.

```{r}
x<-vector("numeric", length = 10)
x
```

The c() function can also be used to create vectors of objects.

```{r}
x<- c(0.5, 0.6) 
class(x)
```

```{r}
z<- c(TRUE, FALSE) ##logical
class(z)
```

```{r}
u <- c(T, F) 
class(u)
```

```{r}
v<- c("a","b","c")
class(v)
```

```{r}
w<- 9:20
class(w)
```

```{r}
k<-c(1+0i, 2+4i)
class(k)
```

#### Data Type: Lists

However, if a "vector" contains objects of different classes, then it is a *list*. The class of list follows the rule of **least common denominator**.

```{r}
m<- c(1.7, "a")
class(m)
```

```{r}
n<-c(TRUE,2)
class(n)
```

The reason why number 2 is the least denominator because TRUE and FALSE these 2 logical objects symbolize number 1 and 0.

```{r}
p<-c("a", TRUE)
class(p)
```

The output of a list separate every element because they are not of a same class.

```{r}
q<-list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
q
```

#### Data Type: Number

Numbers are generally numeric objects. NaN represents undefined value.

#### Data Type: Attributes

Attributes can also be objects in R.

1.  names, dimnames (i.e. dimension names)\
2.  dimensions (e.g. matrices: number of columns and rows symbolizes dimensions; multidimensional arrays)
3.  class
4.  length\
5.  other user-defined attributes/metadataÂ (what you can define separately for an object using various attribute functions)

-   Attributes can be accessed using attributes() function.\
-   Every object has a class and length. For vectors it is very obvious: the length of the object equals the number of elements in the vector.

##### Explicit Coercion between Classes in Vector

Using the as.numeric(), as.logical(), as.character() function, respectively, to convert the vector to your wished class.

```{r}
r<-0:6
r
class(r)
```

```{r}
as.logical(r)
```

```{r}
as.character(r)
```

However, coercion does not work always:

```{r}
t<-c("a","b","c")
as.numeric(t)
as.logical(t)
as.complex(t)
```

if the coercion does not work, the output will be NA.

#### Data Type: Matrices

Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute. The dimension attribute is itself an integer vector of length 2, namely (nrow, ncol).\
- You can use matrix() function to create a matrix.\
- dim() function to check the dimension.\
- attribute() function to convert the dimension to a vector.

```{r}
a <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
a
dim(a)
```

```{r}
attributes(a)
```

When assigning the values, matrices are constructed *column-wise*

```{r}
b<-matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
b
```

And we can also use dim() to convert a vector to a matrix.

```{r}
e<-1:10
dim(e) = c(2,5)
e
```

Another way to create matrices is to use column binding or row binding.

```{r}
e<-1:10
f<-2:11
cbind(e,f)
```

```{r}
rbind(e,f)
```

### Data Type: Factors

Factors are used to represent categorical data, which can be ordered or unordered. 1. integer factor where each integer has a label (e.g. 1 represents "high, 2 represents "medium", 3 represents "low") 2. professor, associated professor, visiting professor... (categorical but ordered)

```{r}
g <- factor(c("no", "no", "yes","no","yes"))
g
```

The two levels of this factor are "no" and "yes".

Use table() function to count the frequency of these two levels:

```{r}
table(g)
```

The unclass() function strips out the class of a factor:

```{r}
unclass(g)
```

The order of levels can be set using *levels* argument to a factor. This is especially useful in linear modelling because the first level is usually used as the baseline level.

```{r}
g <- factor(c("no", "no", "yes","no","yes"), levels=c("yes", "no"))
g
```

### Data Type: Missing Values

Missing values are denoted by NA or NaN. NaN stands for undefined mathematical operations, while NA stands generally all missing values, including NaN.

```{r}
h<-c(1,2,4,NA,5,7)
is.na(h)
```

```{r}
is.nan(h)
```

```{r}
i<-c(1,2,4,NA,NaN,5,7)
is.na(i)
is.nan(i)
```

### Data Type: Data Frames

Data frames are used to store tabular data.\
- Data frames are represented as a special type of list where every element of the list has to have the same length.\
- Each element of the list can be thought as a column and the length of each element of the list is the number of rows.\
- Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column like lists.\
- Every row of a data frame has a name, i.e. a special attribute called *row.names*.(e.g. each row can represent a subject of study, and the row name can be the subject ID)\
- Data frames are usually created by calling *read.csv()* or *read.table()*.\
- Can be converted to a matrix using data.matrix().

```{r}
l<-data.frame(food_id = 1:4, food_name= c("pasta", "rice","bread", "couscous"))
l
```

#### Data Type: Names

```{r}
names(l)
```

Lists can also have names. a, b, c are the names in the example below, and 1, 2, 3 are the associated values.

```{r}
o<-list(a=1, b=2, c=3)
o
```

We can assign names to matrices using dimname() function.

```{r}
w<-matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
dimnames(w)<- list(c("a","b"), c("c", "d"))
w
```

### Functions for Data Reading in R

#### read.csv(), read.table() for tabular data

These functions read text files that contain data stored in rows and columns type of format and return a data frame in R.

read.table() has some important *arguments*\
- *file*, the name of a file or connection\
- *header*, logical indicating if the file has a header line\
- *sep*, a string indicating how the columns are separated\
- *colClasses*, a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset\
- *nrows*, the number of rows in the dataset\
- *comment.char*, a character string indicating the comment character\
- *skip*, the number of lines to skip from the beginning\
- *stringAsFactors*, should character variables be coded as factors?

read.csv() is identical to read.table specified for comma as defaulted separator.

#### readLines()

Use this function to read lines of a text file. This can be any kind of files, just like a vector of characters in R.

#### source()

For reading in R code files (inverse of dump()).

#### dget()

For reading in R code files (inverse of dput()).

#### load()

For reading in saved workspaces.

#### unserialize()

For reading single R objects in binary form.

### Functions for Data Writing in R

-   write.table\
-   writeLines\
-   dump\
-   dput\
-   save\
-   serialize

### Connection Interfaces

Read data using the following functions when applies:\
- *file*: opens a connection to a file\
- *gzfile*: opens a connection to a file compressed with gzip\
- *bzfile*: opens a connection to a file compressed with bzip2\
- *url*: opens a connection to a webpage

### Extract Subsets of Objects

#### Operator []

Always return an object of the same class as the original, and can be used to select more than one element.

#### Operator [[]]

Used to extract elements from a list or a data frame. It can only be used to extract a single element, and the class of the returned object does not have to be a list or a data frame.

#### Operator \$

Used to extract elements of a list or a data frame by name.

**Subsetting Vectors**: Extract the 3rd element of the character vector j.

```{r}
j<-c("a", "b", "c", "d")
j[3]
```

```{r}
j[1:2]
```

Another Example: Using logical index for subset.

```{r}
j[j>"a"]
```

One more example: Creating a logical vector.

```{r}
r<- j>"a"
r
j[r]
```

**Subsetting Lists**:

```{r}
c<-list(foo=1:4, bar=0.6)
c
```

```{r}
c[1]
```

```{r}
c[[1]]
```

With single brackets, we get a list of sequence 1 to 4; With double brackets, we get only the sequence 1 to 4.

**Subsetting Nested Elements of a List**

```{r}
o<-list(a=list(10,12,14), b=c(3.14, 2.81))
o
```

```{r}
o[[c(1,3)]]
o[[c(2,2)]]
```

**Subsetting a Matrix**

```{r}
xx<-matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
xx
```

```{r}
# Select 2nd row, 1st column
xx[2,1]

# Select the 1st row
xx [1,]
# Select the 3rd column
xx [,3]
```

### Remove NA Values

```{r}
yy<-c(1,2,NA,4,NA,5)
bad<-is.na(yy)
yy[!bad]
```

Use complete.cases() function to remove missing values in multiples vectors with missing values.

```{r}
zz<-c("a","b",NA,"d",NA,"f")
good<- complete.cases(yy,zz)
good
```

```{r}
yy[good]
zz[good]
```

### Vectorized Matrix Operations

```{r}
aa<- matrix(1:4, 2,2); bb<-matrix(rep(10,4), 2, 2)
aa
bb
```

```{r}
# Matrix multiplication and division
aa+bb
```

```{r}
aa %*%bb #real matrix multiplication
```

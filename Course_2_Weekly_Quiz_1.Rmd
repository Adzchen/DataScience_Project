#### Question 3. In R the following are all *atomic data* types EXCEPT:

- **Answer**: Array, list, data frame, matrix, table  
- **PS**: use class() function can help you identify the data type



#### Question 4. If I execute the expression x <- 4 in R, what is the class of the object `x'?
```{r}
x <- 4
class(x)
```
- **Answer**: numeric



#### Question 5. What is the class of the object defined by the expression x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)?
```{r}
x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)
class(x)
```
- **Answer**: character



#### Question 6: If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression rbind(x, y)?
```{r}
x <- c(1,3, 5)
y <- c(3, 2, 10)
rbind(x,y)
```
- **Answer**: This is a 2*3 matrix.

Additionally, with cbind(x,y)
```{r}
x <- c(1,3, 5)
y <- c(3, 2, 10)
cbind(x,y)
```
- **Answer**: We can get a 3*2 matrix.



#### Question 7: A key property of vectors in R is that
- **Answer**: Elements of a vector all must be of the same class



#### Question 8: Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[2]] give me? Select all that apply.
```{r}
x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE)
x[[2]]
```
- **Answer**: A character vector containing the letter "a".



#### Question 9: Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and a vector y <- 2. What is produced by the expression x + y?
```{r}
x <- 1:4
y <- 2
x+y
```

- **Answer**: 1:4 means 1 or 2 or 3 or 4. The answer is a numeric vector with elements 3, 4, 5, 6.A numeric vector with elements 3, 4, 5, 6.



#### Question 10: Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.
```{r}
x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10)
x[x > 10] <- 4
```
- **Answer**: assign for under the requirement given in []



#### Question 12: Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?
```{r}
dataset1 <- read.csv("/Users/zhenzhuo.chen/Desktop/hw1_data.csv")
dataset1[1:2,]
```
- **PS**: See this example for extracting specific columns from a dataset. Do not forget the comma.



#### Question 13:How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?
```{r}
nrow(dataset1)
```
- **Answer**: 153
- **PS**: Use fuction nrow() with dataset_name to count the number of rows in a dataset.



#### Question 14: Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?
```{r}
dataset1[152:153,]
```



#### Question 15: What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?
```{r}
dataset1$Ozone[47]
```
- Answer: 21
- **PS**: Dataset_name$column[number_of_the_row]. Using $ to select a specific column.



#### Question 16: How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?
```{r}
sum(is.na(dataset1$Ozone))
```
- **Answer**: 37
- **PS**: Use sum(is.na(dataset_nname)) to count missing values.

#### Question 17: What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.
```{r}
mean(dataset1$Ozone, na.rm=TRUE)
```
- **Answer**: 42.12931
- **PS**: na.rm() is the function to remove missing values NA in the calculation.


#### Question 18ï¼šExtract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
subset_dataset1<-dataset1 %>%
  filter(dataset1$Ozone > 31, Temp>90)
mean(subset_dataset1$Solar.R)
```
- **Answer**: 212.8
- **PS**: I created a new data frame with filter() function from the dplyr package.


#### Question 19: What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6? 
```{r}
mean(dataset1[which(dataset1$Month == 6),]$Temp)
```
- **Answer**: 79.1
- **PS**: which() is a very powerful function that prevents extra steps of creating a new data frame.


#### Question 20: What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month is equal to 5)?
```{r}
max(dataset1[which(dataset1$Month==5),]$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```
- **Answer**: 115
